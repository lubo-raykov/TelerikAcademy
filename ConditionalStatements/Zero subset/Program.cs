//Zero Subset

//We are given 5 integer numbers. Write a program that finds all subsets of these numbers whose sum is 0.
//Assume that repeating the same subset several times is not a problem.
//Examples:

//numbers	result
//3 -2 1 1 8	-2 + 1 + 1 = 0
//3 1 -7 35 22	no zero subset
//1 3 -4 -2 -1	1 + -1 = 0
//1 + 3 + -4 = 0
//3 + -2 + -1 = 0
//1 1 1 -1 -1	1 + -1 = 0
//1 + 1 + -1 + -1 = 0
//0 0 0 0 0	0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0
//Hint: you may check for zero each of the 31 subsets with 31 if statements.
